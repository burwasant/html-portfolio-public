    <p>Hi, my name is John, a web development enthusiast with a background in Civil Engineering and Project Management. 
      I'm currently transitioning into tech to bring my problem-solving skills and dedication to the software development world.</p>
    <h2>My Journey</h2>
    <p>I started my career in multiple industries from Civil Engineering, Health Care, Graphic Design to Project Management.
      Spending several years honing my skills in business and customer relations, critical thinking and problem solving.
      During this time, I realized my passion for design, technical-thinking and problem-solving.
      And in search of my true passion and purpose I was led to pursue tech and web development.</p>

      As I go along this journey and continue to develop my skills, I will be updating this page and all other pages to further showcase
