    <h1>My Favorite Movies and Shows</h1>
    <h2>Movies:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Transformers
            <p>It's my go-to "let's go back to when I was in grade school" movie.</p>
        </li>
        <li>The Blind Side
            <p>My happy-mind movie.</p>
        </li>
        <li>Harry Potter Series
            <p>A must watch at least once a year.</p>
        </li>
        <li>The Lord of the Rings Series
            <p>A must MUST watch at least once a year.</p>
        </li>
        <li>The Pirates of the Caribbean
            <p>Dude. Like. Dude. The acting, the story 
                (maybe for the first three), and THE SOUNDTRACK. DUDE.</p>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>TV Shows</h2>
    <p>Now. I am a huge fan of a good written, fantasy genre.
        So mind you, these are all fantasy shows.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>The Wheel of Time
            <p>Somewhat quenches my thirst for a TV show of The Lord of the Rings.</p>
        </li>
        <li>The Rings of Power
            <p>Actually quenches my thirst for a TV show of The Lord of the Rings.</p>
        </li>
        <li>Shadow and Bones
            <p>The way they balance comedy, action and drama. Man was I hooked after the first episode.</p>
        </li>
        <li>The Witcher
            <p>I am a fan of the Witcher GAME.</p>
        </li>
        <li>Sandman
            <p>Now, I know she's not the main character, 
                but I believe I say this for a lot of people when I say Jennifer Coleman stole my heart, 
                oh and also the show.</p>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>ps. None of these are rankings. I love them all, 
        and I also have so much more but I'm limiting myself to five. 
        If you want the gist of what I look for in film:
        <ul>
            <li>Writing: I have no room for cliches and corny or cheesy</li>
            <li>Music: Good music, and none of that pop copy paste tracks. I need original HUGE MUSIC</li>
            <li>Character: Charismatic in a sense that they're unique and not a ripoff of other loved characters.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>pss. I enjoy all movies. :)</p>
